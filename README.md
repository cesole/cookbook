*healthy Food - Cookbook - Code Institute Milestone Project 3*
In this project, I build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.
In this case, I created a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes with different fields ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, preparation time, type of meal. 
The backend code and frontend form(s) allows users to add new recipes to the site, edit them and delete them.
User can also find recipes based on the type of meal: vegan, vegetarian, diary free desserts.

**UX**
This application is intended for use by all, but mainly people that enjoy healthy food. 

**User Stories**

I like healthy food, but easy to make
As a stay at home dad with limited cooking skilled, I would love to find recipes that are simple and easy to cook for my family.
As a student away from home for the first time, I am looking for somewhere to get easy recipes.


**WireFrames**

Below are the wireframes for the project.
First Idea:


**Layout**
The layout used the Materialize CSS Parallax template which I modified to suit my own requirements.

**Features**
The following section describes the front-end features in this project.

Navbar - Consists of the Healthy Foods logo which returns the user to the "Home" page of the application. There is also links to the "Vegan", "Vegetarian", "Dessert", "Add Recipe" "Login". The navbar will appear on all pages.
Home - The home page consists of 4 sample recipes along with some information on contacting the webmaster and a link to the contact us page of the site.
Social Links - Provides users with links to the website social media pages and also shortcuts to the "All Recipes" & "My Recipes" pages.(Links NOT LIVE current social media pages for this project as this is not a real business).
