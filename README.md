# HEALTHY FOOD - Cookbook - Code Institute Milestone Project 3
Built by **_Cecilia Barriga_**

In this project, I build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.
In this case, I created a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes with different fields ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, preparation time, type of meal. 
The backend code and frontend form(s) allows users to add new recipes to the site, edit them and delete them.
User can also find recipes based on the type of meal: vegan, vegetarian, diary free desserts.


## UX
This application is intended for use by all, but mainly people that enjoy healthy food. 


## WireFrames
Below are the wireframes for the project.

For the 3 meals (vegan, vegetarian & dessert) I made the same wireframe:

## Credits
I found several issues and I struggle with a few things:
- I had to remove :rsv in the MONGO_URI as Heroku was failing
- I had to constantly make sure that the data that I was passing in app.py and the data name in the template and in mongodb were consistent
